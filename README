1) Install Python 3.8, CMake and Tesseract 5. Instructions and installation can be found here:
    https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/

    https://cmake.org/download/

2) Set up the Google Sheets API: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wC-SCdJK2c&t=334s
   Make sure to add email to the desired spreadsheet, download the key and rename it to "service_account.json" whilst placing it within the application's root directory.

3) Navigate and cd the project's root directory before running the command:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4) Make sure to perform the necessary modifications on the config.ini file (enter your spreadsheet's title, specify the image's file type et cetera).

5) Make sure the images adhere more or less to the example provided as example.png (e.g. no border, column space, no team-names, no icons).
   Make sure the background is dark and static. Only detects yellow/red/white text.
   Furthermore, it only accepts three columns of numbers. Place the pictures inside the "Pictures" folder inside the project directory.

 6) Run the main.exe file or main.py with the help of an IDE (Pycharm for example).
